## Customize the Skill to be Yours

At this point, you should have a working copy of our Feed Reader skill.  In order to make it your own, you will need to customize it with data and responses that you create.  Here are the things you will need to change:

1.  **Add new utterances and intents to respond to your users.** There are several sentences and responses that you can modify to customize for your skill.

2.  **New language.** If you are creating this skill for another language other than English, you will need to make sure Alexa's responses are also in that language.

    *  For example, if you are creating your skill in German, every single response that Alexa makes has to be in German.  You can't use English responses or your skill will fail certification.

3.  Once you have made the updates listed on this page, you can click **Next** below to move on to Publishing and Certification of your skill.
